DESCRIPTION
===========

A collection (2 for now) of classic games made completely in bash

  hang.sh:  A hangman game 
  snake.sh: A snake clone game inspired in the 
            [Atari 2600 Surround game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_(video_game))

I could add an ellaborate intro screen for the games, but I prefer the classic 
jump-direct-to-gameplay approach of some of the old Atari 2600 games, enjoy =)

MOTIVATION
==========

Really?
